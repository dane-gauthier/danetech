          <p className='text-lg dark:text-indigo-50 mt-6'>first impressions are everything soooooo, i&apos;m a <a href='https://www.wizardingworld.com/collections/hufflepuff' target='_blank' rel='nooopener noreferrer'>hufflepuff</a>, an <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality' target='_blank' rel='nooopener noreferrer'>enfj-a</a>, jim from the office according to buzzfeed & was once described by a former boss as the ðŸ¦„ unicorn extrovert among our team of developers. i&apos;ve worked for two startups, survived a pandemic and two furloughs, completed a boot camp in 8 months while working a full time job, and can swim 3000 yards in about 2 hours. my goal is to work in tech, building tools to make life easier. i&apos;m pretty tenacious & my goal is to be a full stack developer in the next five years. my strong areas are anything javascript, but i have a long way to go to consider myself an expert. currently, i am focusing on my role as a devops engineer & scrum master @ CGI.</p>
          <p className='text-lg dark:text-indigo-50 mt-6'>starting from social worker to software developer has given me a lot of opportunity yet not without my fair share of struggle. after about 3 years in tech, i still feel like an imposter. the rough plan is to build & learn as much as i can to push through the doubt. so far, it&apos;s working.</p>
